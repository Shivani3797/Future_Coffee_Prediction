# Preface

Coffee, derived from the beans of the Coffea plant, is one of the most popular and widely consumed beverages worldwide. It has a rich cultural and economic significance, often serving as a daily ritual and an essential cash crop around the globe. In recent years, however, the future of coffee production has been concerning due to the potential impact of climate change on its cultivation.

The objective of conducting this study is to investigate the distribution of the Coffea arabica species, known for its high-quality and delicate flavor, in the diverse coffee-growing regions of India. By examining the current distribution patterns and exploring the potential future changes, we aim to shed light on the challenges and opportunities facing coffee production in the country.

This research endeavor is prompted by the growing body of evidence that highlights the vulnerability of coffee cultivation to climate change. Numerous studies have emphasized the potential adverse effects of rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and shifting climatic zones on coffee production. Moreover, projections for the next 50 years suggest significant changes in the suitability and availability of coffee-growing areas worldwide.

To provide a comprehensive analysis, this study will draw upon a range of eye-opening research conducted on the impact of climate change on coffee and its potential depletion in various parts of the World.

By synthesizing the findings from relevant studies, this research aims to contribute to our understanding of the potential consequences of climate change on the distribution of Coffea arabica in India. The study findings will be valuable for policymakers, coffee growers, and other stakeholders in the coffee industry, aiding them in making informed decisions to mitigate the risks and develop sustainable strategies for the future of coffee production.

In conclusion, this study explores the distribution patterns of Coffea arabica species in India, considering the potential impact of climate change on coffee cultivation. By examining existing research and addressing gaps in knowledge, we hope to provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities faced by the coffee industry in India, while also contributing to the broader global discourse on the future of coffee production.

# Objectives

➢ Objective 1: Running the Maxent model to find out impacting climatic variables for coffee arabica species occurrence and its possible distribution with all bioclim variables as impacting factors for the projected year 2021-2040.

➢ Objective 2: Projecting change in predictor variable i.e., annual temperature for the year 2060-2080.

➢ Objective 3: Generalized Linear Modelling for the Karnataka region, predicting coffee arabica species distribution in the state from high contributing bioclim variables.

➢ Objective 4: Time-series analysis of predictor variables (Tmin, Precipitation) to comprehend trends for short-term climate forecast of the study area and ecologically 
relevant areas to species in the current scenario.

# Technologies Used
### Maxent Software

# Conclusion
1.) In conclusion, this study highlights the significance of temperature as a crucial bioclimatic variable that greatly influences Coffee arabica production in India. The impressive AUC curve value of 0.976 further confirms the model's excellence in classification. 

2.) The projected data for the years 2060-2080 paints a clear picture of an inevitable 3-degree Celsius temperature rise in India. This information is essential for understanding the potential future impact of coffee arabica production.

3.) Moreover, utilizing GLM modeling on the current species occurrence locations, it is suggested that under the influence of four major bioclimatic variables, the occurrence of the species is highly likely to deviate by approximately 40 kilometers from its current location by 2060-2080. 

4.) This emphasizes the need to consider the potential geographical shifts that may occur in response to changing bioclimatic conditions. Looking towards the short-term forecast, the Holt linear time series analysis indicates that over the next decade, the production and bearing area of coffee arabica is expected to increase. 

5.) However, it is crucial to note that despite this growth, the concerning trends observed in temperature and precipitation patterns in India will undoubtedly lead to a drastic decrease in productivity (measured in kilograms per hectare).

Taking all these factors into account, it becomes evident that the future of Coffee arabica production in India faces significant challenges due to the predicted rise in temperature and its subsequent impact on productivity. Urgent measures and adaptation strategies should be implemented to mitigate these effects and sustain the coffee industry in the face of changing climate conditions.
