# Preface

Coffee, derived from the beans of the Coffea plant, is one of the most popular and widely 
consumed beverages worldwide. It has a rich cultural and economic significance, often serving 
as a daily ritual and an essential cash crop around the globe. In recent years, however, the future 
of coffee production has been concerning due to the potential impact of climate change on its 
cultivation.

##### The objective of conducting this study is to investigate the distribution of the Coffea arabica species, known for its high-quality and delicate flavor, in the diverse coffee-growing regions of India. By examining the current distribution patterns and exploring the potential future changes, we aim to shed light on the challenges and opportunities facing coffee production in the country.

##### This research endeavor is prompted by the growing body of evidence that highlights the vulnerability of coffee cultivation to climate change. Numerous studies have emphasized the potential adverse effects of rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and shifting climatic zones on coffee production. Moreover, projections for the next 50 years suggest significant changes in the suitability and availability of coffee-growing areas worldwide.
To provide a comprehensive analysis, this study will draw upon a range of eye-opening 
research conducted on the impact of climate change on coffee and its potential depletion in 
various parts of the World.

By synthesizing the findings from relevant studies, this research aims to contribute to our 
understanding of the potential consequences of climate change on the distribution of Coffea 
arabica in India. The study findings will be valuable for policymakers, coffee growers, and 
other stakeholders in the coffee industry, aiding them in making informed decisions to mitigate 
the risks and develop sustainable strategies for the future of coffee production.

In conclusion, this study explores the distribution patterns of Coffea arabica species in India, 
considering the potential impact of climate change on coffee cultivation. By examining existing 
research and addressing gaps in knowledge, we hope to provide valuable insights into the
challenges and opportunities faced by the coffee industry in India, while also contributing to 
the broader global discourse on the future of coffee production.

# Objectives
➢ Objective 1: Running Maxent model to find out impacting climatic variables for coffee 
arabica species occurrence and its possible distribution with all bioclim variables as 
impacting factor for projected year 2021-2040.
➢ Objective 2: Projecting change in predictor variable i.e., annual temperature for year 
2060-2080.
➢ Objective 3: Generalized Linear Modelling for Karnataka region, predicting coffee 
arabica species distribution in state from high contributing bioclim variables.
➢ Objective 4: Time-series analysis of predictor variables (Tmin, Precipitation) to 
comprehend trends for short-term climate forecast of the study area and ecologically 
relevant areas to species in the current scenario.
